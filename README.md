# Benchmarking For Speculative Decoding on vLLM V1

The benchmarking scripts (SLURM files) are generated programmatically using the `create_slurm_files.py` script.
They are created in the `generated-lrz/` directory.
LRZ is the cluster I run the benchmarks on.

Command:

```bash
python create_slurm_files.py
```

The Python script programmatically fills two template files:

- `throughput-sd-template.slurm` for throughput benchmarking **with** speculative decoding
- `throughput-nosd-template.slurm` for throughput benchmarking **without** speculative decoding

If you want to run the SLURM files in your own cluster, you will need modify the template files.
An example are the templates in `slurm-kisski/` directory, which are generated by the same script to the directory `generated-kisski/`.
KISSKI is another cluster I run the benchmarks on.
